            "Original Text 1: Doctors have urged medicine manufacturers to make sweet-tasting Calpol less appealing to children . With 12 million bottles sold each year, Calpol is a medicine cabinet staple in most homes, soothing childhood aches and pains thanks to its main ingredient – paracetamol. But now a leading doctor has warned that children could be at risk of accidental overdose from Calpol and other brightly coloured drugs that ‘look more like milkshake than medicines’. Doctors say that Calpol’s syrup-sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘almost irresistible’ to some youngsters. ‘Some children go to alarming lengths to get their hands on it while their parents’ backs are turned,’ said one. Health professionals have now urged Calpol’s manufacturers to make the medicine less appealing to youngsters to prevent accidental overdose of paracetamol, which can cause serious liver damage and, in rare cases, prove fatal. The plea comes as figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal nearly five children a day were admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the-counter painkillers in one year alone. Concerns have previously been raised that children are given too much paracetamol by GPs and parents who do not realise there are doses in other branded products, such as Lemsip. The Health and Social Care Information Centre statistics show that a staggering 1,691 children aged one to four were admitted to hospital in 2012-13 because of ‘accidental poisoning’ by medicines including non-prescription painkillers ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin. Although perfectly safe within the recommended doses, paracetamol is one of the easiest drugs on which to overdose. Unlike with other drugs, patients do not need much more than the advised amount before it starts to cause problems. A 2007 study found 84 per cent of babies are given Calpol in their first six months. The brand’s Infant Suspension Formula, suitable for babies aged two months and over, is pink and strawberry-flavoured, while the Six Plus formula is orange-flavoured and coloured. Doctors say that Calpol’s syrup-sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘almost irresistible’ to some children, but it can be dangerous . Doctor and author Dr Max Pemberton warns that children could be getting ‘mixed messages’ on the potential dangers that lurk inside the bottles. ‘The introduction of child-proof tops and blister packs for pills mean it is harder for children to get hold of medicines these days, but these figures revealing the number of children admitted to hospital show that, sadly, some still do,’ he says. ‘With a medicine like Calpol, the bright packaging and appealing taste means a young child could mistake it for sweets. The purple packaging for the Infant Suspension reminds you of Cadbury’s chocolate, and the medicine itself looks more like milkshake. ‘How can we expect a child to understand that something that looks and tastes so nice actually has the potential to do harm if they have too much?’ Calpol is used to treat common childhood conditions including fever, earache and teething trouble. Official guidelines state babies aged between three and six months should be given no more than 240mg of paracetamol a day. That’s the equivalent of just two 5ml teaspoons of Calpol Infant Suspension formula. Infants aged six to 24 months can be given 5ml up to four times a day. Dr Pemberton has urged Johnson and Johnson, Calpol’s manufacturers, to rethink the formula – and its packaging. Nearly five children a day are admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol . ‘Paracetamol is an everyday painkiller but it has potential to cause serious harm, particularly to a child as their organs are less developed and more fragile,’ he says. Dr Sally Gibbs, an A&E consultant at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, says worried parents with children who have drunk over-the-counter medicines are a familiar sight in emergency departments. She adds: ‘Sometimes the child has climbed up to get it from the medicine cabinet, or the parents may not have put it properly out of reach or failed to make sure the top is on securely. Older siblings may give it to their little brother or sister. ‘Children may reach for Calpol as they recall having it before, and that it tastes nice.’ Online parenting forum Mumsnet contains posts from concerned parents whose children have obtained the medicine. One wrote: ‘I’ve just found a bottle of Calpol Six Plus open. They [the children] climbed up into the cupboard and managed to open the so-called child-proof lid. Half a bottle has gone.’ Public health nutritionist Dr Helen Crawley says she cannot understand why sweeteners such as sucrose are used to make Calpol more palatable when a spoonful of milk would help the medicine go down just as well. ‘The bright pink colour of Calpol could be related to overdose in children who are picking it up and think it’s something like Ribena,’ she warns. ‘Colourless medicine would be fine, and would reduce this risk. There is no rationale for using colours or artificial sweeteners.’ A Johnson and Johnson spokesman said: ‘We are committed to patient safety and have numerous safeguards in place to prevent any accidental childhood poisoning. ‘The caps on bottles of Calpol are thoroughly tested to resist a child’s attempts to access the product. ‘The pink colour in Calpol Infant Suspension is long-standing and helps compliance for children by making the medicine they need more acceptable for them. A colour-free variant is also available simply to give parents greater choice, and is not related to any safety concerns.’\n",

            "Original Text 2: The infamous hoarders' house - dubbed Australia's most squalid - is being sold by the NSW Sheriff's Office to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on clearing the mountains of rubbish collected on the property, it has been revealed. It has also emerged that whoever buys the free-standing home at 19 Boonara Avenue in Bondi, just a few hundred metres from the world famous beach - may also have to pay to evict the current owners, who have previously refused to clear up the junk or move out to allow council inspectors inside. Debt collectors, on behalf of Waverley Council, have arranged to sell the home - which remarkably could fetch at least $2 million in the hope of recovering the $180,000 the Bobolas family owes for the clean up costs. Scroll down for video . Liana Bobolas,  pictured here in April sitting beside her piles of trash, is one of three owners being forced to sell the squalid Bondi house . After amassing an enormous debt to the local council, the notorious family  are being forced to sell their garbage-strewn property . Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about $2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family . The new owners will have to apply for to the Supreme Court for a writ of possession to evict them, which can take four weeks, according to The Daily Telegraph. A spokesperson for Justice NSW said 'after the sheriff receives the writ, they give the occupants 30 days to vacate the premises. If they do not vacate willingly, the sheriff has the power to force an eviction.' Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news. 'I can't believe it. We have just bought a house here and moved in on Saturday. That's fantastic for the whole street,' Yael Super told The Telegraph. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house, but otherwise the family will be given the remainder of the profits after the debts have been cleared. The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'. The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement. The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets' The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard . Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news the family are being evicted . The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data. Waverley Council have set a date to demolish the garage and remove the piles of garbage that surround the house. The Bobolas have resisted all offers to connect them with support services, and adamantly defended council clean-ups in court. The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard. More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property. With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house . The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data . A ginger cat has made a home for itself among the piles of cardboard boxes and old plastic containers . The property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home. The council cleaned the property in mid-2014, but some neighbours said the house was as bad as they'd ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'. Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity. More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property . The street is one of the most expensive in Bondi, located just a kilometre from the iconic Bondi Beach . Plastic bags full of garbage, slabs of wood, what looks to be old carpet samples and cardboard boxes litter the front of the house .\n",

            "Original Text 3: Serial reality TV star Jamie Otis married a complete stranger on television just moments after branding the wedding 'the worst decision of my entire life' as she didn't find her new husband in anyway attractive. The 27-year-old agreed to  marry software salesman Doug Hehner, 31, on the first episode of FYI's new extreme reality show Married at First Sight. In the show, the contestants agree to marry a complete stranger and live with them for four weeks before deciding whether to continue with the arrangement or seek a divorce. Scroll down for video . Jamie Otis, pictured, looks nervous as she walks up the aisle during the first episode of the reality TV show . The nerves soon turned to complete disappointment when she saw her intended husband, Doug Hehner, pictured, describing her first sight of him as 'the worst feeling... I just happen not to be attracted to the guy' Otis left viewers of the controversial show wondering whether she was going to marry the man selected for her. During the voice over, Otis said: 'This is the worst feeling. Obviously I wasn't like, \"what a knockout!\" 'I couldn't help but look at his family, because they were like, beaming, huge smiles, looking at me, and I just happen not to be attracted to the guy.' The reality TV veteran provided the show's producers with the cliffhanger they wanted. She said: 'I'm getting married right now to someone I don't know. I'm thinking I just made the worst decision of my life. I am so scared.' Otis had previously appeared on The Bachelor and spin-off series The Bachelor Pad. But, despite the cliffhanger, Otis soon took to Twitter to announce the fact that she was now married . Doug Hehner appeared during the show to have been far happier with the experts' choice of partner . Reality TV veteran Jamie Otis told her twitter followers that she can't say whether she's still married to Hehner . According to US Magazine, her intended husband soon picked up on the nurse's reluctance. Hehner told viewers: 'She was freaking out. And it seems like she doesn't know what's going on .It was a tense moment.' The six contestants were 'matched' by a group of four experts including a sexologist, a spiritualist, a psychologist and a sociologist. The experts sifted though hundreds of applicants before deciding upon the final six people. Otis had previously sought TV love on the reality show The Bachelor. Sexologist Dr Logan Levkoff told Jezebel that each of the matches was a real marriage. She said: 'This experiment seeks to determine whether social science can play a role in marital success. 'If we can offer a new way to find a connection (and a long-lasting one), imagine the possibilities!' Otis, pictured, said it was difficult finding true love in New York City, so signed up for her third reality TV show . Otis told the New York Post: 'In New York City, I feel like the guys are primarily just players until they’re hitting their late 30s. It’s tough to find guys who are serious.' The show is based on a format first used in Denmark. In an interview with The Knot, Otis revealed: 'The truth is, I never envisioned a traditional wedding for myself. 'Nothing about my life is traditional, so why worry about having a traditional wedding? 'It was a genuinely intimate, personal, and real experience. It's been a life-changing journey.\"\n",

            "Original Text 4: The Queen is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of  King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the age of 90. Her Majesty, who is 88, was born on April 21, 1926 and has reigned through more than five decades, celebrating her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. She took the throne at the age of 25. But despite being the oldest monarch in the world - she is only the second longest-reigning. King Rama IX of Thailand has served for 68 years whereas the Queen's reign is just under 63 years. Scroll down for video . The Queen is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of King of Saudi Arabia Abdullah at the age of 90 (pictured together in 2007) King Abdullah died in hospital last night aged 90 and was immediately replaced by his brother Prince Salman, 79. His death will be upsetting for Her Majesty and her family, having built a close relationship with him. Death: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz died following a battle with pneumonia . He was taken to hospital on New Year’s Eve with suspected pneumonia, is believed to have left four wives and 22 children after nearly ten years on the throne of one of the world’s richest countries. It is likely that Prince Charles – a personal friend of King Abdullah – will attend his funeral today. Either the Queen will make the Royal Flight available to Charles or a private jet will be chartered. King Abdullah was one of the 37 sons of King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, who created the modern state of Saudi Arabia in 1932. His brother Prince Salman, 79, is already king but there were concerns last night that, despite the swift succession, the news would send shockwaves across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is already facing uncertainty over the recent dip in global oil prices and the rise of terror group Islamic State in neighbouring Iraq. The price of crude oil rose by two per cent on the world markets after the king’s death was announced. The Prime Minister has paid tribute to his work for peace in the region. Friends:  Prince Charles and King Abdullah were personal friends. The Prince of Wales  is expected to attend his funeral today . The new King Salman, pictured arriving in Tokyo in 2014, is taking over as monarch at the age of 79 . David Cameron, who visited Saudi Arabia in 2012, said: 'I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abd Al Aziz Al Saud. Queen Elizabeth II: 88 years, 277 days . King Abdul Halim Kedah of Malaysia: 87 years, 56 days . King Rama IX of Thailand: 87 years, 49 days . King Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait: 85 years, 221 days . King Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi Ajman of United Arab Emirates: 84 years, 22 day . Saudi blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam has second flogging postponed for another week after doctors rule he has still not sufficiently recovered . Jury selection begins in New York for Saudi businessman who 'orchestrated' 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa . Saudi king 'halts flogging of blogger facing 1,000 lashes' after Middle Eastern country accused of 'outrageous inhumanity'. 'He will be remembered for his long years of service to the Kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths. 'My thoughts and prayers are with the Saudi Royal Family and the people of the Kingdom at this sad time. 'I sincerely hope that the long and deep ties between our two Kingdoms will continue and that we can continue to work together to strengthen peace and prosperity in the world.' US President Barack Obama hailed the late king as ‘candid and passionate’ and added: ‘As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah’s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship. As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.’\n",

            "Original Text 5: The death of an 11-year-old aboriginal girl with leukemia who died less than a year after her family allowed her to stop chemotherapy will be investigated by a local coroner. Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, died on Monday after suffering a stroke the day before. Her grief-stricken family blamed her death on the three-month course of chemotherapy she underwent last year for  leukemia, before she chose to stop the treatment. In a statement, they said the young cancer sufferer had been improving with traditional healing methods but the chemotherapy had damaged her body. Scroll down for video . Visions: Cancer-stricken Makayla Sault, who refused chemotherapy, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed in this YouTube clip made in May. She died on Monday, her family said in a statement . Her parents, pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, told the Two Row Times: 'Makayla was on her way to wellness, bravely fighting toward holistic well-being after the harsh side effects that 12 weeks of chemotherapy inflicted on her body. 'Chemotherapy did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs. This was the cause of the stroke. We continue to support Makayla's choice to leave chemotherapy. 'At this time we request privacy from the media while we mourn this tragic loss. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 and suffered weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer. The grueling weeks of the chemo sent her cancer into remission. However doctors said that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needed to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. Makayla's parents allowed their daughter to give up the chemo, a move that prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton where Makayla was being treated to alert children's authorities. The family were investigated by a division of Canada's Children’s Aid Society, who decided to allow them to continue to care for Makayla without requiring the chemotherapy treatments. Makayla stopped chemo after 12 weeks of treatment when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 . The office of the chief coroner in Ontario confirmed there was now an ongoing investigation into Makayla’s death, but a spokesman said it was a routine investigation sparked by the earlier Children’s Aid Society probe. In May, Makayla read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her she was already healed. The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and 10lb lighter, to recover for two weeks after her first treatment. 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore. 'I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla said in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she said. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she added. Also during that time, Makayla said she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination. Parents Ken and Sonya Sault said in a statement this week that chemotherapy did irreversible damage to their daughter's heart and major organs .\n",

Her Majesty, who is 88, was born on April 21, 1926 and has reigned through more than five decades, celebrating her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. She took the throne at the age of 25. But despite being the oldest monarch in the world - she is only the second longest-reigning. King Rama IX of Thailand has served for 68 years whereas the Queen's reign is just under 63 years. Scroll down for video . The Queen is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of King of Saudi Arabia Abdullah at the age of 90 (pictured together in 2007) King Abdullah died in hospital last night aged 90 and was immediately replaced by his brother Prince Salman, 79. His death will be upsetting for Her Majesty and her family, having built a close relationship with him. Death: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz died following a battle with pneumonia . He was taken to hospital on New Year’s Eve with suspected pneumonia, is believed to have left four wives and 22 children after nearly ten years on the throne of one of the world’s richest countries. It is likely that Prince Charles – a personal friend of King Abdullah – will attend his funeral today. Either the Queen will make the Royal Flight available to Charles or a private jet will be chartered. King Abdullah was one of the 37 sons of King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, who created the modern state of Saudi Arabia in 1932. His brother Prince Salman, 79, is already king but there were concerns last night that, despite the swift succession, the news would send shockwaves across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is already facing uncertainty over the recent dip in global oil prices and the rise of terror group Islamic State in neighbouring Iraq. The price of crude oil rose by two per cent on the world markets after the king’s death was announced. The Prime Minister has paid tribute to his work for peace in the region. Friends:  Prince Charles and King Abdullah were personal friends. The Prince of Wales  is expected to attend his funeral today . The new King Salman, pictured arriving in Tokyo in 2014, is taking over as monarch at the age of 79 . David Cameron, who visited Saudi Arabia in 2012, said: 'I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abd Al Aziz Al Saud. Queen Elizabeth II: 88 years, 277 days . King Abdul Halim Kedah of Malaysia: 87 years, 56 days . King Rama IX of Thailand: 87 years, 49 days .

Saudi king 'halts flogging of blogger facing 1,000 lashes' after Middle Eastern country accused of 'outrageous inhumanity'. 'He will be remembered for his long years of service to the Kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths. 'My thoughts and prayers are with the Saudi Royal Family and the people of the Kingdom at this sad time. 'I sincerely hope that the long and deep ties between our two Kingdoms will continue and that we can continue to work together to strengthen peace and prosperity in the world.' US President Barack Obama hailed the late king as ‘candid and passionate’ and added: ‘As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah’s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship.

            "Original Text 5: The death of an 11-year-old aboriginal girl with leukemia who died less than a year after her family allowed her to stop chemotherapy will be investigated by a local coroner. Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, died on Monday after suffering a stroke the day before. Her grief-stricken family blamed her death on the three-month course of chemotherapy she underwent last year for  leukemia, before she chose to stop the treatment. In a statement, they said the young cancer sufferer had been improving with traditional healing methods but the chemotherapy had damaged her body. Scroll down for video . Visions: Cancer-stricken Makayla Sault, who refused chemotherapy, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed in this YouTube clip made in May. She died on Monday, her family said in a statement . Her parents, pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, told the Two Row Times: 'Makayla was on her way to wellness, bravely fighting toward holistic well-being after the harsh side effects that 12 weeks of chemotherapy inflicted on her body. 'Chemotherapy did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs. This was the cause of the stroke. We continue to support Makayla's choice to leave chemotherapy. 'At this time we request privacy from the media while we mourn this tragic loss. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 and suffered weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer. The grueling weeks of the chemo sent her cancer into remission. However doctors said that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needed to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. Makayla's parents allowed their daughter to give up the chemo, a move that prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton where Makayla was being treated to alert children's authorities. The family were investigated by a division of Canada's Children’s Aid Society, who decided to allow them to continue to care for Makayla without requiring the chemotherapy treatments. Makayla stopped chemo after 12 weeks of treatment when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 . The office of the chief coroner in Ontario confirmed there was now an ongoing investigation into Makayla’s death, but a spokesman said it was a routine investigation sparked by the earlier Children’s Aid Society probe. In May, Makayla read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her she was already healed. The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and 10lb lighter, to recover for two weeks after her first treatment. 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore. 'I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla said in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she said. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she added. Also during that time, Makayla said she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination. Parents Ken and Sonya Sault said in a statement this week that chemotherapy did irreversible damage to their daughter's heart and major organs .\n",

            "Original Text 1: Doctors have urged medicine manufacturers to make sweet-tasting Calpol less appealing to children . With 12 million bottles sold each year, Calpol is a medicine cabinet staple in most homes, soothing childhood aches and pains thanks to its main ingredient – paracetamol. But now a leading doctor has warned that children could be at risk of accidental overdose from Calpol and other brightly coloured drugs that ‘look more like milkshake than medicines’. Doctors say that Calpol’s syrup-sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘almost irresistible’ to some youngsters. ‘Some children go to alarming lengths to get their hands on it while their parents’ backs are turned,’ said one. Health professionals have now urged Calpol’s manufacturers to make the medicine less appealing to youngsters to prevent accidental overdose of paracetamol, which can cause serious liver damage and, in rare cases, prove fatal. The plea comes as figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal nearly five children a day were admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the-counter painkillers in one year alone. Concerns have previously been raised that children are given too much paracetamol by GPs and parents who do not realise there are doses in other branded products, such as Lemsip. The Health and Social Care Information Centre statistics show that a staggering 1,691 children aged one to four were admitted to hospital in 2012-13 because of ‘accidental poisoning’ by medicines including non-prescription painkillers ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin. Although perfectly safe within the recommended doses, paracetamol is one of the easiest drugs on which to overdose. Unlike with other drugs, patients do not need much more than the advised amount before it starts to cause problems. A 2007 study found 84 per cent of babies are given Calpol in their first six months. The brand’s Infant Suspension Formula, suitable for babies aged two months and over, is pink and strawberry-flavoured, while the Six Plus formula is orange-flavoured and coloured. Doctors say that Calpol’s syrup-sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘almost irresistible’ to some children, but it can be dangerous . Doctor and author Dr Max Pemberton warns that children could be getting ‘mixed messages’ on the potential dangers that lurk inside the bottles. ‘The introduction of child-proof tops and blister packs for pills mean it is harder for children to get hold of medicines these days, but these figures revealing the number of children admitted to hospital show that, sadly, some still do,’ he says. ‘With a medicine like Calpol, the bright packaging and appealing taste means a young child could mistake it for sweets. The purple packaging for the Infant Suspension reminds you of Cadbury’s chocolate, and the medicine itself looks more like milkshake. ‘How can we expect a child to understand that something that looks and tastes so nice actually has the potential to do harm if they have too much?’ Calpol is used to treat common childhood conditions including fever, earache and teething trouble. Official guidelines state babies aged between three and six months should be given no more than 240mg of paracetamol a day. That’s the equivalent of just two 5ml teaspoons of Calpol Infant Suspension formula. Infants aged six to 24 months can be given 5ml up to four times a day. Dr Pemberton has urged Johnson and Johnson, Calpol’s manufacturers, to rethink the formula – and its packaging. Nearly five children a day are admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol . ‘Paracetamol is an everyday painkiller but it has potential to cause serious harm, particularly to a child as their organs are less developed and more fragile,’ he says. Dr Sally Gibbs, an A&E consultant at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, says worried parents with children who have drunk over-the-counter medicines are a familiar sight in emergency departments. She adds: ‘Sometimes the child has climbed up to get it from the medicine cabinet, or the parents may not have put it properly out of reach or failed to make sure the top is on securely. Older siblings may give it to their little brother or sister. ‘Children may reach for Calpol as they recall having it before, and that it tastes nice.’ Online parenting forum Mumsnet contains posts from concerned parents whose children have obtained the medicine. One wrote: ‘I’ve just found a bottle of Calpol Six Plus open. They [the children] climbed up into the cupboard and managed to open the so-called child-proof lid. Half a bottle has gone.’ Public health nutritionist Dr Helen Crawley says she cannot understand why sweeteners such as sucrose are used to make Calpol more palatable when a spoonful of milk would help the medicine go down just as well. ‘The bright pink colour of Calpol could be related to overdose in children who are picking it up and think it’s something like Ribena,’ she warns. ‘Colourless medicine would be fine, and would reduce this risk. There is no rationale for using colours or artificial sweeteners.’ A Johnson and Johnson spokesman said: ‘We are committed to patient safety and have numerous safeguards in place to prevent any accidental childhood poisoning. ‘The caps on bottles of Calpol are thoroughly tested to resist a child’s attempts to access the product. ‘The pink colour in Calpol Infant Suspension is long-standing and helps compliance for children by making the medicine they need more acceptable for them. A colour-free variant is also available simply to give parents greater choice, and is not related to any safety concerns.’\n",

His brother Prince Salman, 79, is already king but there were concerns last night that, despite the swift succession, the news would send shockwaves across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is already facing uncertainty over the recent dip in global oil prices and the rise of terror group Islamic State in neighbouring Iraq. The price of crude oil rose by two per cent on the world markets after the king’s death was announced. The Prime Minister has paid tribute to his work for peace in the region. Friends:  Prince Charles and King Abdullah were personal friends. The Prince of Wales  is expected to attend his funeral today . The new King Salman, pictured arriving in Tokyo in 2014, is taking over as monarch at the age of 79 . David Cameron, who visited Saudi Arabia in 2012, said: 'I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abd Al Aziz Al Saud. Queen Elizabeth II: 88 years, 277 days . King Abdul Halim Kedah of Malaysia: 87 years, 56 days . King Rama IX of Thailand: 87 years, 49 days . King Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait: 85 years, 221 days . King Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi Ajman of United Arab Emirates: 84 years, 22 day . Saudi blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam has second flogging postponed for another week after doctors rule he has still not sufficiently recovered . Jury selection begins in New York for Saudi businessman who 'orchestrated' 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa . Saudi king 'halts flogging of blogger facing 1,000 lashes' after Middle Eastern country accused of 'outrageous inhumanity'. 'He will be remembered for his long years of service to the Kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths. 'My thoughts and prayers are with the Saudi Royal Family and the people of the Kingdom at this sad time. 'I sincerely hope that the long and deep ties between our two Kingdoms will continue and that we can continue to work together to strengthen peace and prosperity in the world.' US President Barack Obama hailed the late king as ‘candid and passionate’ and added: ‘As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah’s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship. As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions.’\n",

            "Original Text 5: The death of an 11-year-old aboriginal girl with leukemia who died less than a year after her family allowed her to stop chemotherapy will be investigated by a local coroner. Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, died on Monday after suffering a stroke the day before. Her grief-stricken family blamed her death on the three-month course of chemotherapy she underwent last year for  leukemia, before she chose to stop the treatment. In a statement, they said the young cancer sufferer had been improving with traditional healing methods but the chemotherapy had damaged her body. Scroll down for video . Visions: Cancer-stricken Makayla Sault, who refused chemotherapy, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed in this YouTube clip made in May. She died on Monday, her family said in a statement . Her parents, pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, told the Two Row Times: 'Makayla was on her way to wellness, bravely fighting toward holistic well-being after the harsh side effects that 12 weeks of chemotherapy inflicted on her body. 'Chemotherapy did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs. This was the cause of the stroke. We continue to support Makayla's choice to leave chemotherapy. 'At this time we request privacy from the media while we mourn this tragic loss. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 and suffered weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer. The grueling weeks of the chemo sent her cancer into remission. However doctors said that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needed to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. Makayla's parents allowed their daughter to give up the chemo, a move that prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton where Makayla was being treated to alert children's authorities. The family were investigated by a division of Canada's Children’s Aid Society, who decided to allow them to continue to care for Makayla without requiring the chemotherapy treatments. Makayla stopped chemo after 12 weeks of treatment when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 . The office of the chief coroner in Ontario confirmed there was now an ongoing investigation into Makayla’s death, but a spokesman said it was a routine investigation sparked by the earlier Children’s Aid Society probe. In May, Makayla read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her she was already healed. The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and 10lb lighter, to recover for two weeks after her first treatment. 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore. 'I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla said in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she said. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she added. Also during that time, Makayla said she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination. Parents Ken and Sonya Sault said in a statement this week that chemotherapy did irreversible damage to their daughter's heart and major organs .\n",
